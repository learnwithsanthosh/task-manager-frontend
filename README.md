- Set up routing with placeholder pages: Home, Tasks
- Added Header and Footer layout components

# Day 12 â€“ React + Spring Boot Integration: Fetch Tasks

## âœ… What was done:

- Axios instance created in React
- Task type defined for TypeScript
- Used `useEffect` to call `GET /tasks` from backend
- Rendered list of tasks in React frontend
- Connected full stack: Spring Boot + React + Docker DB (local)

## ðŸ”— Next Step:

- Add form to **create new task**
- Implement update/delete functionality

# Day 13 â€“ Task Creation (React + Spring Boot API)

## âœ… What was done:

- Created a form in React with fields:
  - Task Title
  - Task Description
- Handled form submission with axios
- Sent a POST request to Spring Boot backend
- Task saved in DB and rendered in frontend UI dynamically

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Used:

- React with TypeScript and Axios
- Spring Boot with REST API
- JSON payload with title, description, completed

## ðŸ”— Next Steps:

- Implement task update (complete/incomplete)
- Implement task deletion

```

# Day 15 â€“ React: Update Task (PUT Integration)

## âœ… What was implemented

- Added checkbox to toggle task completion status
- Used Axios PUT request to update task via Spring Boot backend
- Dynamically updated UI after successful API response
- Handled optimistic UI updates for better UX

## ðŸ§  Learning:

- `onChange` with checkbox
- Working with mapped arrays
- PUT request structure with Axios
